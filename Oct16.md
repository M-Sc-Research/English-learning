✅ جواب درست کدوم بود؟ 


گزینه 1:

🔵 Had you told me before it was too late, I might have been able to prevent this mistake.

 🤔چرا درسته؟

✅ چون جمله شرطی نوع سومه (برای گذشته‌ای که دیگه تغییر نکردنیه).

توی شرط سوم باید بگیم:

🔹 If + had + past participle

 یا حالت برعکسش:
 🔹 Had + subject + past participle.


🚨اینجا داریم: Had you told me… (یعنی «اگر گفته بودی»).

توی نتیجه هم باید بگیم: 

✅ might / could / would + have + past participle.

توی این جمله گفتیم: 
might have been able to prevent 
«شاید می‌توانستم جلویش را بگیرم».
