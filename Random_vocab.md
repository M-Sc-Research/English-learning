💥💥
1. Do you like cooking? Why / why not?

📌Sometimes. I like preparing a special meal for family or friends who visit, but everyday cooking is a bit boring; it's something that has to be done, but it's not really fun.

2. Who did the cooking in your family when you were a child?

📌My mother almost always did the cooking when I was young. I don't think she trusted my father to make a nice meal.

3. Do you think that it's important to know how to cook well?

📌I'm not sure whether it's important to cook well, but I do think that everyone should know the basics. It definitely isn't healthy to rely on pre-prepared meals or fast food.

4. Do you think that children should be taught cookery at school?

📌Yes, that's probably a good idea. If all children knew how to cook a few basic, healthy meals, that would surely be a good thing.
