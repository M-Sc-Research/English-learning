**My version:**
Hesam my ex-boyfriend was a body-builder. He always wears boots with jeans and also he
wears a tight T-shirt to show his muscles. For his birthday I bought a necklace and ring for
him and he always put it even when we broke up.
In summer he wears glasses with a hat and loose pants you know the ones with some hip-hop
guy wearing.
One day we went to a party with each other and he was handsome. I remember he wore a fit
suit with a black tie and I wore a long black dress, shoulder bag with sandals and
because that night was cold I wore a windbreaker on it. I wanted to wear a shirt with a short
skirt but he said that was not comfortable for me and you should try on the dress He knows
me.
After two years of breaking up with Hesam, I wanted to connect with a reddish-blonde guy with
casually dressed, a guy always with shorts and a loose jacket and sneakers but Hesam, had
made me used to relationships with handsome men.

**AI version:**
Hesam was my ex-boyfriend, and he used to be a bodybuilder. He had a distinctive(specific) style of
wearing boots with jeans and tight T-shirts to show off his muscles. I once bought him a necklace
and a ring for his birthday, and even after we broke up, he continued wearing them. In the summer,
he would wear glasses, a hat, and loose pants that were reminiscent of hip-hop fashion.
On one occasion, we attended a party together and Hesam looked quite handsome. He had chosen
to wear a fitted suit with a black tie, while I wore a long black dress with a shoulder bag and sandals.
Since it was a cold night, I also wore a windbreaker on top. Initially, I wanted to wear a shirt with a
short skirt, but Hesam suggested that I try the dress instead. He knew me well.
After two years of breaking up with Hesam, I found myself attracted to a reddish-blonde guy who
often dressed casually in shorts, a loose jacket, and sneakers. However, Hesam had set the
standard for me, and I had become accustomed to being with handsome men.
