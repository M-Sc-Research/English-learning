ðŸ”†We can have light rain (little rain) or heavy rain (lots of rain, intense rain) â€“ and if the rain gets REALLY intense, we can describe it as torrential rain. If the rain continues without stopping, then we call it continuous rain or constant rain â€“ but if itâ€™s the type of rain that starts and stops various times throughout the day, itâ€™s called intermittent rain or scattered showers. When it stops raining, you can say the rain let up.
