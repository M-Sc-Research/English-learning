  > Hello, my name is Rebecca. I am from Italy and the question is do you like traveling? Yes, I like traveling very much. Traveling – it's like a hobby for me, and I save money for traveling and to go to the places I wish to know. It's a nice experience every time. It's wonderful. Knowing different people, different cultures is something that teaches you so much about the world and it's amazing. And there is a stereotype that you have to be rich in order to be able to travel. It just depends on your preferences: whether you are willing to stay in a five-star hotel and spend a fortune on  restaurant cuisine or if, instead of that, you are perfectly willing to stay in a hostel and cook for yourself on a shoestring budget. Personally I think that a traveller can both enjoy the experience of travelling and learn about different cultures and customs. This surely enhances their view of the world, increases their tolerance towards other cultures and helps develop their knowledge. It is said that travellers gain first-hand experiences which are more important than the theoretical knowledge we can gather from books. Moreover, travelling helps us to get away from our monotonous routines and it aids in reviving us in order to concentrate with greater diligence upon our employment tasks.


## Most difficult words to pronounce

| Word       | Pronunciation     |
|------------|--------------------|
| monotonous | /məˈnɑtənəs/      |
| stereotype  | /ˈstɛ.ɹi.əˌtaɪp/  |

## Prepositions and particles
Words such as in, over and with are prepositions. We commonly use prepositions to show a relationship in space or time or a logical relationship between two or more people, places or things. Prepositions are most commonly followed by a noun phrase, a pronoun or the -ing form of a verb.
## Suffixes
A suffix is a letter or group of letters added at the end of a word which makes a new word.
##  Passive voice

Passive: active and passive

We use the terms active voice and passive voice to talk about ways of organising the content of a clause:

    Cambridge University Press published this book. (active)

    This book was published by Cambridge University Press. (passive)

The active voice is the typical word order. We put the subject (the topic or the theme) first. The subject is the ‘doer’ or agent of the verb:

    Edward Barnes designed these houses in the 1880s. (active)

In the passive, the person or thing that the action was done to becomes the topic or theme. We can leave out the ‘doer’ or agent, or we can place the ‘doer’ in a prepositional phrase (by + ‘doer’):

    These houses were designed in the 1880s. (passive without agent)

    These houses were designed in the 1880s by Edward Barnes. (passive + by + agent)

We use the passive when we want to change the focus of a clause, or if the doer of the verb is not important or not known or if we do not want to say who the doer is
